## Patch changelog:
- Changed Flora and Natalie back to being your mom and sister (this affects names, dialog, some images, etc) [(example)](https://i.lensdump.com/i/8voMRM.png) &nbsp;[(example 2)](https://i.lensdump.com/i/8voneq.png)
- Restored old dialog that was removed or changed &nbsp;[(example)](https://i.lensdump.com/i/8vovyA.png)
- Made Zoe's eyes and chest attractive &nbsp;[(image)](https://i.lensdump.com/i/8voeJD.png)
- Removed that weird...thing...on the main character's neck &nbsp;[(comparison)](https://i.lensdump.com/i/8voS80.png)
- Removed the RNG bullshit from the "spend time with" events for Violet and Claire. You now always get +2 points because fuck it, I was going to savewhore anyways.
- When you start the basketball minigame, if you talk to Sofia she will ask if you want to cheat. If you say yes you automatically get 3/3 baskets and skip the minigame. She also will tell you to git gud.
- Using the fortune teller to cheat no longer changes your name (she still calls you a wimp though)
- All game files have been decrypted
- All non-animated images/CGs can now be opened/viewed in the game folder
- I hid two small easter eggs (that have no impact on the game), who will be the first to find them?
- **June 13th update - Added a save converter and fixed the Natalie bug.**

## Installation:
- I know I called this a 'patch' but the download is the entire game with the patch already installed, meaning there's no special patch installation. So I guess it isn't technically a patch. You can call it the 'Remastered Edition' if you'd like.

<br>
<br>

## Converting game saves:
- If you want to use your old saves with the incest patch they need to be converted first. If for some reason you no longer want to play with the incest patch, you can convert your saves back so they'll work with the unpatched game.

#### Natalie bug:
- In an old version of my patch (before June 13th) there was a bug with the Hypno Natalie #6 scene animation. Use [the fix from this post](https://f95zone.com/threads/school-of-lust-v0-21c-boner-games.6555/page-47#post-796601) to fix it. The current download already includes this fix.
